        <h2>Grounded in Federal Law and Policy</h2>
        <p>Federal technology transfer is shaped by a robust legal foundation. My approach is informed by in-depth knowledge of the legislative and regulatory framework that governs these activities, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Bayh-Dole Act (1980)</strong> â€“ Enabling small businesses and non-profits to retain rights to inventions made with Federal funding, while establishing obligations related to invention reporting and commercialization.</li>
          <li><strong>The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act (1980)</strong> â€“ Creating the legal basis for technology transfer from Federal laboratories to the private sector, and authorizing mechanisms like CRADAs.</li>
          <li><strong>The Morella Amendments (2001)</strong> â€“ Enhancing the tech transfer mission by elevating the role of the Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA) and streamlining IP licensing practices.</li>
          <li><strong>The Atomic Energy Act (1954, as amended)</strong> â€“ Governing the control and dissemination of nuclear technology and associated data, especially relevant in areas like fusion energy and advanced reactor R&D, and as the legislative authority for DOE SPP activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding how these authorities interact is essential to structuring successful, compliant collaborationsâ€”especially in high-stakes or emerging technology fields.</p>

        <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Accelerate Time to Agreement by anticipating and avoiding common negotiation hurdles.</li>
          <li>Enhance Strategic Positioning in areas like intellectual property, technical data rights, and publication.</li>
          <li>Navigate Regulatory and Institutional Complexity with greater confidence and foresight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Iâ€™m not just familiar with the agreementsâ€”I understand how they are implemented within the context of Federal authority and mission-driven R&D environments.</p>

        <h2>Letâ€™s Talk</h2>
        <p>If your organization is preparing to collaborate with a DOE lab, DoD facility, or other federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), I can help ensure youâ€™re well-positionedâ€”both contractually and strategically.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Use Cases: Strategic Support Across Sectors</h2>
        <p>The path to collaboration with national laboratories is rarely one-size-fits-all. From navigating statutory authorities to negotiating data rights and agreement terms, each engagement presents unique challenges depending on the technology area, funding mechanism, and agency mission. Below are examples of how my consulting services have helped companies across diverse sectorsâ€”from fusion energy to quantum computingâ€”structure more effective, efficient, and strategically sound partnerships with DOE and other federal labs.</p>
